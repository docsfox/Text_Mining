The Druids kept fires burning all the year in honor of the sungod. On the last night of October they met at the altars where their fires were burning put them out with much pomp and ceremony and again relighted them. They took embers from the new fires returned home and kindled fires on their own hearths. Superstition had it that a home where one of these fires burned constantly throughout the year was protected from all evil. Later on any fire kept evil spirits away.

Other fortunes may be obtained at a post office received in the form of a letter postal package or paper.

Kiss the shadow if you dare Of the black cat on the stair. With paper and scissors form the habit To cut a very cunning rabbit. Whistle a tune or sing a song Don't keep the audience waiting long. Perform a dance or whistle very Like a wild bird or canary. Hide nuts about the room allow the guest three minutes to search and the one with the most obtains a prize. Hide animal crackers also give each guest a folded paper on which is written such a verse as Soon you'll hear the lion roar You never met the like before. He must search for the animalcracker lion if he finds any other animal he must leave it undisturbed for the right party to find. Jingles about the animals may readily be prepared by the hostess. A few are suggested The elephants gait is slow and steady You see his trunk is always ready. The friendly cow is often seen On this night of halloween.

The pictures may be cut from dark tag board and lowered from above or shifted in from the side or real people may pose back of the sheet if desired. To make a screen have a sheet stretched between a doorway back of which a bright light is placed. Have the other room dark in which the audience is assembled. The performers in posing between the light and the sheet make the shadows. Suppose at night on halloween The Witch appears upon the screen Tell me would anybody scream Witch appears. Suppose the Owl whos very wise Should wink and blink his great round eyes Would he take you by surprise Owl cut from cardboard with eyes cut out so that light shines through. Suppose the Cat grew larger by half I wonder would it make you laugh So you would lean upon a staff Cat cut from cardboard. Move same nearer light to produce enlarging effect. Suppose Jacko'Lantern spoke to you And in accents crisp and new Said Ho ho ho I've come for you Jacko'Lantern cut from cardboard with eyes nose and mouth cut out so that light shines through. Suppose the Brownies beckoning hand Lured you out to Fairyland His language would you understand Have a hand extended back of screen in the act of beckoning. A Ghost you see scary as can be He eats superstitions regularly Hes looking for you looking for me. Ghost appears. Throw the apple paring round Gently three times on the ground My lovers initials I have found. A girl throws paring. Mirror mirror tell me true On halloween what can I do If you reflect a face thats new A girl with mirror someone looking over her shoulder.

Little boys with real Jacko'Lanterns run back of sheet then come out in front and bow. The Black Cat Stunt A student in cap and gown stands across from a table where a very quiet gentle cat is held still by a child. Children in a row at the back of stage hold up books as though studying. The student recites THE STUFFED CAT Who stuffed that cat No one spoke in school For 'twas study time and against the rule. The children in their seats might stare The visitor little did he care. What a very ridiculous nose What an exceedingly awkward pose Such extremely pointed ears Have never belonged to a cat my dears. And those big round shining eyes Never belonged to a cat that size If a real cat on the table sat He'd be inclined to laugh at that Who stuffed that cat Was it a clown Who always jokes in striped gown Tho' I'm not old or very wise For a cat you've made an odd disguise. When anything you want to do Its well to learn the thing 'tis true Excuse me if I laugh at that Your very funny old STUFFED CAT The child holding the cat pokes it the cat rises and walks about the children laugh while the student shows his surprise and walks off in an indignant manner. A Pumpkin Climbing Game The children are shown a room with half a dozen pumpkins on the floor. They practice walking about stepping over them. One is blindfolded. The pumpkins are quickly removed and the rest laugh at his efforts to step over them. Apples or candles in candlesticks may be used instead of pumpkins. This game makes much laughter.

She was finally won by Vertumnus the god of the changing year. To win her he had to take on many forms. Offerings were made to those gods in Rome at festival time. CHARACTERS OctoberA tall girl. WitchA tall girl or boy. TrumpeterA small boy. ApplesFour girls. PearsFour girls. BananasFour girls. GrapesFour girls. ChildA small boy. PomonaA young lady. SuitorsAny number of boys. VertumnusA young man. COSTUME SUGGESTIONS While no special costumes are necessary they will add to the program. The fruits especially should be made to represent what they speak of and the Horn of Plenty may be made of pasteboard decorated with colored fruits and flowers or a large waste basket filled with fruits would do for this purpose. October will be pretty crowned with autumn leaves. There will be no difficulty in getting a long black cape for the Witch and a pointed black hat. She carries a cane and raps on the floor when ready to recite. Consult any ancient history for costumes for Pomona and her suitors. Scene I In the woods. October I am October my fruits are mellow My autumn leaves are red and yellow I am October my voice you hear On halloween the fall of the year. Witch Same old jokes on halloween Same old pumpkins too are seen October with your skies so blue Can't you think up something new October By my side old Witch please stay And we'll enact a little play Pomona goddess of fruits I'll call And she will entertain us all. Vertumnus too I'll conjure here The god he is of the turning year Witch Ha ha the story I remember He comes long before November Though many shapes he takes to woo her Nothing ever seems to do her Until he dons a gossips shoes For truly she is fond of news October Her attendants we'll call without delay For Pomona now is on her way. A Trumpeter appears and blows his horn each time before a fruit or group of fruits enter. Apples Apples rosy Apples red See us nodding overhead Apples rosy round and sweet Everywhere are good to eat. Dance around in couples and line up at back of stage. Pears We are Pears so very shy Scarcely nodding to passersby As we heard Pomona call We'll do her honor one and all. Dance in a circle and line up beside Apples. Bananas We're Bananas spick and spandy And you always find us handy Ripe Bananas are so sweet You will find us quite a treat. Bow to partners circle round each other and line up at back. Grapes Purple Grapes in early fall We have heard Pomonas call And we come in late October For the summer hours are over. Join hands skip forward and back line up at back. Child enters with Horn of Plenty they circle around her singing. Tune Coming Through the Rye. To the woodland we are going Late on halloween We've no other way of knowing What strange sights are seen But we bring the Horn of Plenty At this time of year And a festival we're keeping For Pomonas here. Pomona enters and is seated at right the fruits in turn go to her and bow and the child offers her the Horn of Plenty. Many suitors now come bowing to her in turn they offer her fall fruits and flowers and gifts carrying them in baskets or on trays the Knave of Hearts even comes offering her his tarts and Simple Simon offers her a pie. Last of all comes Vertumnus he is larger and more powerful than the rest he simply offers her an enormous red pasteboard heart. Vertumnus Vertumnus the god of the turning year I come Pomona behold me here Offerings are made to me in Rome Will you share my fortunes Pomona come. Pomona waves him away with the rest of the company and the curtain falls. Scene II Witchs quarters in woods. The Witch and Vertumnus seated at a table are talking over their cups of tea. Witch I'm the Witch of halloween Many curious sights I've seen. I'm also a gipsy as you see I'll tell your fortune With leaves of tea. You must wear disguise you understand If you would win Pomonas hand. Go as a Ploughman talk of spring Roses to her cheeks you'll bring. As a Fisherman talk of summer time Charm her with your song and rhyme. A Reaper has enchanting ways When he sings of autumn days. As Old Woman Winter in ice and snow You'll interest her I'm sure its so. When you have enchanted her then arise You can safely throw off your last disguise. Vertumnus Such fortunes in tea leaves we've seen I'll cry. Hurrah for halloween Hurrah hurrah for your time and trouble May your kettle always boil and bubble. Witch Vertumnus now if you are wise You'll not forget to wear disguise. Vertumnus In disguise I'll journey you understand To seek again Pomonas hand. Scene III Pomonas home in the woods. Pomona seated by spinning wheel. A knock is heard enter Vertumnus as ploughman. Vertumnus Fair Pomona I can not help but sing today I come to tell you of all the beauties of spring. If you will come with me to the fields you will see new life returning everywhere. In every little blade of grass upspringing in every mellow bird note there is natures call. See I have brought you the first violets. Pomona Very beautiful is your breath of spring and the message the violets bring me but I would far rather stay here by my spinning wheel for even now nights and mornings are chilly. I care not for your wild sweet spring music. Vertumnus goes out. While Pomona spins he returns as a fisherman. Vertumnus I am a Fisherman since you ask it I made a catch that will fill your basket. How we all love summer summer Shes a fashionable newcomer. Now sweet summer with her roses Happiness for all proposes. Pomona I care not for your wonderful catch of fish or for your summer roses. I have had bouquets before. Go back to your stream young fisherman perhaps the fish will listen to your clumsy verses. He goes out returns as reaper with a scythe or cycle. Vertumnus What wonderful seasons we have Pomona this is the harvest time. What a wealth of flowers fruits and nuts meet our gaze and the cheerful bonfires are lighted everywhere. Soon halloween will be here. I almost imagined I saw a Witch as I entered. The Witch peeps over the screen waving hand to audience. I dream I hear Octobers laughter as she shakes the trees from which the leaves leap and dance to the last ball of the season. October peeps over screen and laughs. Will you come with me Pomona Pomona does some real acting while this last recitation is given she appears almost to yield but replies. Pomona As I am the goddess of fruits you almost persuade me. I hear the faroff hunters horn I feel the spell of halloween but noI am not easily won. Vertumnus now goes out and reenters as old woman winter he wears a long cape with hood. Vertumnus Have you heard the news You must surely know. They say and they say and they say. Oh yes I look like old winter with my frosty fingers but see I bring Christmas and sleighing and good times and gossip. Ha ha Oh yes I pay quite a fortune for shoes for I travel so far to carry the news. Witch over the screen Gossip now is going to win her Keep at it whatever you do Gossip like a hardened sinner Stands you in good stead 'tis true.

The children in their seats might stare The visitor little did he care. What a very ridiculous nose What an exceedingly awkward pose Such extremely pointed ears Have never belonged to a cat my dears. And those big round shining eyes Never belonged to a cat that size If a real cat on the table sat He'd be inclined to laugh at that Who stuffed that cat Was it a clown Who always jokes in striped gown Tho' I'm not old or very wise For a cat you've made an odd disguise. When anything you want to do Its well to learn the thing 'tis true Excuse me if I laugh at that Your very funny old STUFFED CAT The child holding the cat pokes it the cat rises and walks about the children laugh while the student shows his surprise and walks off in an indignant manner.

She was finally won by Vertumnus the god of the changing year. To win her he had to take on many forms. Offerings were made to those gods in Rome at festival time. CHARACTERS OctoberA tall girl. WitchA tall girl or boy. TrumpeterA small boy. ApplesFour girls. PearsFour girls. BananasFour girls. GrapesFour girls. ChildA small boy. PomonaA young lady. SuitorsAny number of boys. VertumnusA young man. COSTUME SUGGESTIONS While no special costumes are necessary they will add to the program. The fruits especially should be made to represent what they speak of and the Horn of Plenty may be made of pasteboard decorated with colored fruits and flowers or a large waste basket filled with fruits would do for this purpose. October will be pretty crowned with autumn leaves. There will be no difficulty in getting a long black cape for the Witch and a pointed black hat. She carries a cane and raps on the floor when ready to recite. Consult any ancient history for costumes for Pomona and her suitors. Scene I In the woods. October I am October my fruits are mellow My autumn leaves are red and yellow I am October my voice you hear On halloween the fall of the year. Witch Same old jokes on halloween Same old pumpkins too are seen October with your skies so blue Can't you think up something new October By my side old Witch please stay And we'll enact a little play Pomona goddess of fruits I'll call And she will entertain us all. Vertumnus too I'll conjure here The god he is of the turning year Witch Ha ha the story I remember He comes long before November Though many shapes he takes to woo her Nothing ever seems to do her Until he dons a gossips shoes For truly she is fond of news October Her attendants we'll call without delay For Pomona now is on her way. A Trumpeter appears and blows his horn each time before a fruit or group of fruits enter. Apples Apples rosy Apples red See us nodding overhead Apples rosy round and sweet Everywhere are good to eat. Dance around in couples and line up at back of stage. Pears We are Pears so very shy Scarcely nodding to passersby As we heard Pomona call We'll do her honor one and all. Dance in a circle and line up beside Apples. Bananas We're Bananas spick and spandy And you always find us handy Ripe Bananas are so sweet You will find us quite a treat. Bow to partners circle round each other and line up at back. Grapes Purple Grapes in early fall We have heard Pomonas call And we come in late October For the summer hours are over. Join hands skip forward and back line up at back. Child enters with Horn of Plenty they circle around her singing. Tune Coming Through the Rye. To the woodland we are going Late on halloween We've no other way of knowing What strange sights are seen But we bring the Horn of Plenty At this time of year And a festival we're keeping For Pomonas here. Pomona enters and is seated at right the fruits in turn go to her and bow and the child offers her the Horn of Plenty. Many suitors now come bowing to her in turn they offer her fall fruits and flowers and gifts carrying them in baskets or on trays the Knave of Hearts even comes offering her his tarts and Simple Simon offers her a pie. Last of all comes Vertumnus he is larger and more powerful than the rest he simply offers her an enormous red pasteboard heart. Vertumnus Vertumnus the god of the turning year I come Pomona behold me here Offerings are made to me in Rome Will you share my fortunes Pomona come. Pomona waves him away with the rest of the company and the curtain falls. Scene II Witchs quarters in woods. The Witch and Vertumnus seated at a table are talking over their cups of tea. Witch I'm the Witch of halloween Many curious sights I've seen. I'm also a gipsy as you see I'll tell your fortune With leaves of tea. You must wear disguise you understand If you would win Pomonas hand. Go as a Ploughman talk of spring Roses to her cheeks you'll bring. As a Fisherman talk of summer time Charm her with your song and rhyme. A Reaper has enchanting ways When he sings of autumn days. As Old Woman Winter in ice and snow You'll interest her I'm sure its so. When you have enchanted her then arise You can safely throw off your last disguise. Vertumnus Such fortunes in tea leaves we've seen I'll cry. Hurrah for halloween Hurrah hurrah for your time and trouble May your kettle always boil and bubble. Witch Vertumnus now if you are wise You'll not forget to wear disguise. Vertumnus In disguise I'll journey you understand To seek again Pomonas hand. Scene III Pomonas home in the woods. Pomona seated by spinning wheel. A knock is heard enter Vertumnus as ploughman. Vertumnus Fair Pomona I can not help but sing today I come to tell you of all the beauties of spring. If you will come with me to the fields you will see new life returning everywhere. In every little blade of grass upspringing in every mellow bird note there is natures call. See I have brought you the first violets. Pomona Very beautiful is your breath of spring and the message the violets bring me but I would far rather stay here by my spinning wheel for even now nights and mornings are chilly. I care not for your wild sweet spring music. Vertumnus goes out. While Pomona spins he returns as a fisherman. Vertumnus I am a Fisherman since you ask it I made a catch that will fill your basket. How we all love summer summer Shes a fashionable newcomer. Now sweet summer with her roses Happiness for all proposes. Pomona I care not for your wonderful catch of fish or for your summer roses. I have had bouquets before. Go back to your stream young fisherman perhaps the fish will listen to your clumsy verses. He goes out returns as reaper with a scythe or cycle. Vertumnus What wonderful seasons we have Pomona this is the harvest time. What a wealth of flowers fruits and nuts meet our gaze and the cheerful bonfires are lighted everywhere. Soon halloween will be here. I almost imagined I saw a Witch as I entered. The Witch peeps over the screen waving hand to audience. I dream I hear Octobers laughter as she shakes the trees from which the leaves leap and dance to the last ball of the season. October peeps over screen and laughs. Will you come with me Pomona Pomona does some real acting while this last recitation is given she appears almost to yield but replies. Pomona As I am the goddess of fruits you almost persuade me. I hear the faroff hunters horn I feel the spell of halloween but noI am not easily won. Vertumnus now goes out and reenters as old woman winter he wears a long cape with hood. Vertumnus Have you heard the news You must surely know. They say and they say and they say. Oh yes I look like old winter with my frosty fingers but see I bring Christmas and sleighing and good times and gossip. Ha ha Oh yes I pay quite a fortune for shoes for I travel so far to carry the news. Witch over the screen Gossip now is going to win her Keep at it whatever you do Gossip like a hardened sinner Stands you in good stead 'tis true. Gossip about whatever you choose Drop a word here and there to carry the news Never mind who listens over the screen I'm the merry old Witch of halloween. Pomona rises from stool and yields to Vertumnus. Vertumnus drops his disguise and takes Pomona by the hand. They march forward and bow. The Witch enters at right October at left. Witch The goddess of fruits to merry October Calls Goodbye the summer is over. October Vertumnus the god of the turning year Hath won her now it doth appear. Pomona What our kind friends say is true So we call Goodbye to you. Vertumnus Come let the fall fruits and flowers Return for a few more happy hours. All who have taken part reenter heralded by trumpeter line up sing. Tune Battle Hymn. Oh autumn time is coming You can hear her trumpets call While the fruits and nuts are falling There is plenty for us all. We go o'er hill and valley Making bonfires in the fall In happy harvest time. Chorus. Sing three cheers for glad October Sing three cheers for summers over Jack Frost comes a merry rover In happy harvest time. Oh autumn time we love you With your fields of ripened wheat And so bountiful the harvest All the glories we repeat. And at the hour of sunset You can hear our marching feet In happy harvest time.

applesfour girls. pearsfour girls. bananasfour girls. grapesfour girls. childa small boy. pomonaa young lady. suitorsany number of boys. vertumnusa young man. costume suggestions while no special costumes are necessary they will add to the program. the fruits especially should be made to represent what they speak of and the horn of plenty may be made of pasteboard decorated with colored fruits and flowers or a large waste basket filled with fruits would do for this purpose. october will be pretty crowned with autumn leaves. there will be no difficulty in getting a long black cape for the witch and a pointed black hat. she carries a cane and raps on the floor when ready to recite. consult any ancient history for costumes for pomona and her suitors. scene i in the woods. october i am

do her until he dons a gossips shoes for truly she is fond of news october her attendants we will call without delay for pomona now is on her way. a trumpeter appears and blows his horn each time before a fruit or group of fruits enter. apples apples rosy apples red see us nodding overhead apples rosy round and sweet everywhere are good to eat. dance around in couples and line up at back of stage. pears we are pears so very shy scarcely nodding to passersby as we heard pomona call we will do her honor one and all. dance in a circle and line up beside apples. bananas we are bananas spick and spandy and you always find us handy ripe bananas are so sweet you will find us quite a treat. bow to partners circle round each other and line up at back. grapes purple grapes in early fall we have heard pomonas call and we come in late october for the summer hours are over. join hands skip forward and back line up at back. child enters with horn of plenty they circle around her singing. tune coming through the rye. to the woodland we are going late on halloween we have no other way of knowing what strange sights are seen but we bring the horn of plenty at this time of year and a festival we are keeping for pomonas here. pomona enters and is seated at right the fruits in turn go to her and bow and the child offers her the horn of plenty. many suitors now come bowing to her in turn they offer her fall fruits and flowers and gifts carrying them in baskets or on trays the knave of hearts even comes offering her his tarts and simple simon offers her a pie. last of all comes vertumnus he is larger and more powerful than the rest he simply offers her an enormous red pasteboard heart. vertumnus vertumnus the god of the turning year i come pomona behold me here offerings are made to me in rome will you share my fortunes pomona come. pomona waves him away with the rest of the company and the curtain falls. scene ii witchs quarters in woods. the witch and vertumnus seated at a table are talking over their cups of tea. witch i am the witch of halloween many curious sights i have seen. i am also a gipsy as you see i will tell your fortune with leaves of tea. you must wear disguise you understand if you would win pomonas hand. go as a ploughman talk of spring roses to her cheeks you will bring. as a fisherman talk of summer time charm her with your song and rhyme. a reaper has enchanting ways when he sings of autumn days. as old woman winter in ice and snow you will interest her i am sure its so. when you have enchanted her then arise you can safely throw off your last disguise. vertumnus such fortunes in tea leaves we have seen i will cry. hurrah for halloween hurrah hurrah for your time and trouble may your kettle always boil and bubble. witch vertumnus now if you are wise you will not forget to wear disguise. vertumnus in disguise i will journey you understand to seek again pomonas hand. scene iii pomonas home in the woods. pomona seated by spinning wheel. a knock is heard enter vertumnus as ploughman. vertumnus fair pomona i can not help but sing today i come to tell you of all the beauties of spring. if you will come with me to the fields you will see new life returning everywhere. in every little blade of grass upspringing in every mellow bird note there is natures call. see i have brought you the first violets. pomona very beautiful is your breath of spring and the message the violets bring me but i would far rather stay here by my spinning wheel for even now nights and mornings are chilly. i care not for your wild sweet spring music. vertumnus goes out. while pomona spins he returns as a fisherman. vertumnus i am a fisherman since you ask it i made a catch that will fill your basket. how we all love summer summer she is a fashionable newcomer. now sweet summer with her roses happiness for all proposes. pomona i care not for your wonderful catch of fish or for your summer roses. i have had bouquets before. go back to your stream young fisherman perhaps the fish will listen to your clumsy verses. he goes out returns as reaper with a scythe or cycle. vertumnus what wonderful seasons we have pomona this is the harvest time. what a wealth of flowers fruits and nuts meet our gaze and the cheerful bonfires are lighted everywhere. soon halloween will be here. i almost imagined i saw a witch as i entered. the witch peeps over the screen waving hand to audience. i dream i hear octobers laughter as she shakes the trees from which the leaves leap and dance to the last ball of the season. october peeps over screen and laughs. will you come with me pomona pomona does some real acting while this last recitation is given she appears almost to yield but replies. pomona as i am the goddess of fruits you almost persuade me. i hear the faroff hunters horn i feel the spell of halloween but noi am not easily won. vertumnus now goes out and reenters as old woman winter he wears a long cape with hood. vertumnus have you heard the news you must surely know. they say and they say and they say. oh yes i look like old winter with my frosty fingers but see i bring christmas and sleighing and good times and gossip. ha ha oh yes i pay quite a fortune for shoes for i travel so far to carry the news. witch over the screen gossip now is going to win her keep at it whatever you do gossip like a hardened sinner stands you in good stead it is true. gossip about whatever you choose drop a word here and there to carry the news never mind who listens over the screen i am the merry old witch of halloween. pomona rises from stool and yields to vertumnus. vertumnus drops his disguise and takes pomona by the hand. they march forward and bow. the witch enters at right october at left. witch the goddess of fruits to merry october calls goodbye the summer is over. october vertumnus the god of the turning year hath won her now it doth appear. pomona what our kind friends say is true so we call goodbye to you. vertumnus come let the fall fruits and flowers return for a few more happy hours. all who have taken part reenter heralded by trumpeter line up sing. tune battle hymn. oh autumn time is coming you can hear her trumpets call while the fruits and nuts are falling there is plenty for us all. we go over hill and valley making bonfires in the fall in happy harvest time. chorus. sing three cheers for glad october sing three cheers for summers over jack frost comes a merry rover in happy harvest time. oh autumn time we love you with your fields of ripened wheat and so bountiful the harvest all the glories we repeat. and at the hour of sunset you can hear our marching feet in happy harvest time. chorus. curtain or march off halloween puppet play the puppets are shown over a screen and a

      "1783, when a certain democratic simplicity was beginning to temper the\r\n",

      "much excuse for his rusty buckles, his cheap wisp of a cravat (in\r\n",
      "which a costly diamond burned), his hired equipage and single equerry,\r\n",

      "had withdrawn from a Court whose master was always more concerned with\r\n",

      "necessitous oblivion. Debts, contracted in the days of promise, came\r\n",
      "winging paper billets after him, and his situation was soon fairly\r\n",
      "desperate. His wife died, and he gave her grand-ducal obsequies. His\r\n",

      "The Château di Rocco stood well back, among pine woods, from the\r\n",
      "little village of Les Chables on the Argentière Road. Above it sloped\r\n",
      "the stony steeps of the Flegère; below were huddled neglected\r\n",
      "terraces, like dams to check the further descent of the house into the\r\n",
      "valley. It might, in its relation to the huge quarry which contained\r\n",
      "it, have been part of the mountain itself, a vast boulder torn away\r\n",
      "from its parent rock, and retaining in relief the form of the socket\r\n",
      "from which it had parted. Towers, pinnacles and walls, heaped up like\r\n",
      "an enormous ice-mould, seemed to have shaped themselves to the uproar\r\n",
      "of avalanches, and falling torrents, and the thunder of the wind which\r\n",
      "uproots whole hill-sides. Yet it was so old itself as to have\r\n",
      "withstood a legion of assaults and survived unshaken. It had been the\r\n",
      "stronghold of the di Roccos from the days when the passes of the Alps\r\n",
      "were a very active trust in the keeping of the border lords, and was\r\n",
      "still a formidable veteran of its stones.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Within, a world of sombre and tarnished magnificence witnessed to the\r\n",
      "hands of great mechanics of the past generations. Only the spirit\r\n",
      "which could minister to such traditions was debased beyond recall.\r\n",
      "What strain was responsible for its existing lord’s, who could say?\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Château, all in all, was a savage, stone-locked, cold-harbour of\r\n",
      "a place, the teeth of whose very ghosts chattered as they walked its\r\n",
      "vaulted corridors. It was haunted throughout by sounds and whispers of\r\n",
      "cold—the boom of subterranean waters; the high rustle of snow; the\r\n",
      "growl of ice splitting in the great glaciers opposite. The wind\r\n",
      "whistled in its halls, lifting the skirts of the tapestry in a sort of\r\n",
      "stately dance, as if the phantom figures thereon were at a minuet to\r\n",
      "warm themselves. There was not a closet in all its recesses which\r\n",
      "might have been called cosy, nor a rat behind its wainscoting which\r\n",

      "Dr Bonito, private physician to the Count, was himself as waxy a\r\n",
      "spectre as any which inhabited there. His face was like a\r\n",
      "topographical map, with all its features in low relief—wrinkles for\r\n",
      "rivers, dull eyes for lakes, a nose like a rudimentary volcano. There\r\n",
      "was no expression whatever on it but what seemed to derive from\r\n",
      "drought and starvation, and no colour but a bilious glaze, which\r\n",
      "pimpled here and there into red. A death-mask of him might very well\r\n",

      "thought to coin a millennium out of the alloy. Or it had thought to\r\n",
      "once. Rosicrucianism was not founded, professedly, to interfere with\r\n",
      "the polity or religions of States, but simply to pursue the True\r\n",
      "Philosophy—to “follow the Gleam.” Yet no secret society, I suppose,\r\n",
      "has ever failed, when success has brought it self-conscious of its\r\n",
      "power, to abuse its mission; and certainly Dr Bonito, as a latter-day\r\n",
      "Frater Roseæ-Crucis, distilled other and less perfumed waters than\r\n",
      "utilitarianism from his alembics. He was an empiric, in fact, and\r\n",
      "lived on the gross superstition of his employer—barely, it is true,\r\n",
      "but resignedly, since Di Rocco had promised him a legacy proportionate\r\n",
      "with his services in keeping him alive, and a very bonanza should he\r\n",
      "conduct him well over the Biblical span. For which reason Bonito\r\n",
      "scarcely resented his present treatment, because he counted every\r\n",
      "penny now withheld from him as a penny invested against his future.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Plumpness, under the circumstances, was hardly to be expected of him;\r\n",

      "Mr Trix laughed again, pulling at his long pipe. He had a reckless\r\n",
      "young dark face, jet-eyebrowed, winsome out of wickedness, and\r\n",
      "handsome enough to be a perpetual passport to his desires. His form,\r\n",
      "properly slim and elastic for the “blade” that he was, was “sheathed,”\r\n",
      "quite elegantly for di Rocco, in cloth of a fine black, and with a\r\n",
      "ruff of Valenciennes lace at its breast. A glass and a bottle of old\r\n",
      "wine stood at his elbow.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“True,” he said, “I deplore the loss of our late good company. And so\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M. Louis-Marie Saint-Peray lodged in the house of a M. Paccard, Le\r\n",
      "Prieuré’s respectable doctor, and an enthusiast in matters of\r\n",
      "geology. Everyone loved Louis-Marie, even, in a sweet, impartial way,\r\n",
      "the doctor’s only daughter, Martha, who, however, had other geese to\r\n",
      "pluck in the matrimonial market. The young man was so good and so\r\n",
      "good-looking, so pious, so enthusiastic and so sensible. Anticipating\r\n",
      "the boy-angel of “Excelsior,” he came storming the frozen heights,\r\n",
      "which, nevertheless, he was not to attain. But his failures made the\r\n",
      "true romance of his endeavours—in the eyes of women, at least, who do\r\n",
      "not admire the cocksureness which comes of success. As to the men, the\r\n",
      "rugged mountaineers, who were experienced in the natural limitations\r\n",
      "to their craft, they mingled, perhaps, a little contempt with their\r\n",
      "liking. It would be all very well to put their knowledge to school by\r\n",
      "showing it the way up Mont Blanc; but, in the meanwhile, aspirations\r\n",
      "were not deeds. They all, for the matter of that, aspired to conquer\r\n",
      "the great white peak, but their women did not applaud them for the\r\n",
      "wish. True, they had not, not one of them, M. Saint-Péray’s serene\r\n",
      "white face, and kindling blue eyes, and hair of curling sunbeams. Yet\r\n",
      "Le Prieuré was not deficient in manly beauty, however little it might\r\n",
      "derive from an exclusive ancestry of angels.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Le Prieuré, in Louis-Marie’s time, was a rude enough valley, and\r\n",
      "almost forbidden ground to the ease-loving traveller. That was one\r\n",
      "reason, perhaps, why the women so favoured this gentle stranger, who\r\n",
      "came to them on his own initiative out of the despised world of\r\n",
      "luxury. If he brought with him the traditions of tender breeding, he\r\n",
      "brought also its fearless spirit. It was something god-like in him to\r\n",
      "defy, in his frail person, that unconquerable keep of the mountains.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was good in itself; but a closer appeal was to reach them on the\r\n",
      "occasion of his second visit. For it was then that he and Yolande met\r\n",
      "for the first time, and provided in their meeting the basis for a more\r\n",
      "poignant romance than any which had yet glorified him. Within a week,\r\n",
      "every wife in Le Prieuré thrilled in the knowledge of a secret\r\n",
      "fathomed only by herself.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One wet July morning Louis-Marie left the doctor’s door and turned his\r\n",
      "face for Le Marais, which was a little dedicatory chapel standing\r\n",
      "under pine woods on the lower slopes of the Montverd. It was there he\r\n",
      "had first come upon Yolande, the saintly loveliness, craving some boon\r\n",
      "of the sacred heart; and what better rendezvous could the two\r\n",
      "afterwards appoint than the little holy shrine which had brought them\r\n",
      "mutually acquainted with the sweetest of all boons?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Louis-Marie walked up the village street his heart sang like a bird\r\n",
      "with joy. It was full of thankfulness to the God of orthodoxy, who was\r\n",
      "nevertheless the God of nature and of love. How easy and how\r\n",
      "profitable it was to earn approval in those great eyes! One had only\r\n",
      "to keep the faith of a little child, to ask no questions, to court no\r\n",
      "vexing heresies, and be happy. And so to be rewarded for one’s\r\n",
      "happiness, as witness himself twice blessed. He had done nothing but\r\n",
      "be good according to his orthodox lights, and for that virtue, which\r\n",
      "was instinct, here was he glorified in the affection of the loveliest\r\n",
      "lily of womanhood which had ever blossomed in a by-way of the world.\r\n",
      "He turned and breathed a laugh in the direction of the unsurmountable\r\n",
      "peak, hidden now within league-deep folds of mist. What was there to\r\n",
      "gain which seemed other than trivial in the light of his higher\r\n",
      "achievement? The mountain was shrunk to a mole-hill under that star,\r\n",
      "that altitude.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no wind; the wet dropped softly, caressingly; the fields\r\n",
      "were full of flowers. Louis-Marie could interpret the talk between\r\n",
      "them and the earnest rain. The patches of standing rye were stippled\r\n",
      "with poppies. He recognised why the supreme artist had touched them in\r\n",
      "here and there and nowhere else. Sacred love was the understanding\r\n",
      "love after all; he felt that he had been given the gift of tongues.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took no sense of depression from the drowning mist. The gloom made\r\n",
      "the lamp of his heart shine the more friendly, smiling on all things\r\n",
      "in its consciousness of the ecstatic wings which were waiting up there\r\n",
      "to flutter to it in a little. He had no doubt of himself, or of his\r\n",
      "right to hold that lure to them. Perhaps he had no reason to have. He\r\n",
      "came, for all worldly considerations, of an old and stately family,\r\n",
      "and he had his orphan’s patrimony—nothing great, but enough to bring\r\n",
      "him within the bounds of eligibility in the eyes of a poor Chevalier.\r\n",
      "If he had consented hitherto to make a secret of his suit, it was\r\n",
      "because he could not find it in his heart to materialise the first\r\n",
      "virgin rapture of that idyll—to submit it to flesh-and-blood\r\n",
      "conditions. There was no other reason; or, if one was to be suspected\r\n",
      "in M. de France’s pride and aloofness, as gossip painted them, he\r\n",
      "would not admit to himself that he had been influenced by it. But, in\r\n",
      "any case, propriety, always to him the little thing more than love,\r\n",
      "without which love itself must lack perfection, demanded its\r\n",
      "vindication the moment he realised that it was in question; and he was\r\n",
      "now actually on his way, in fact, to entreat his love’s consent to an\r\n",
      "appeal to the paternal sanctions.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Half-way down the village street he encountered a young fellow, a\r\n",
      "friend of his, and one intimately associated with some past ambitions.\r\n",
      "This was Jacques Balmat, already the most experienced of mountaineers\r\n",
      "at twenty-two. His dark eager face and bold eyes showed in significant\r\n",
      "contrast with the girlish pink and blue of the other’s. He held out a\r\n",
      "handful of pebbles.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Louis-Marie was in no hurry. “For Dr Paccard, Jacques?” he asked, with\r\n",
      "a smile. The young man nodded his head.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some of them are rare enough, monsieur. I risk my life in getting\r\n",
      "them. But who would win the daughter must court the father.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was significance as well as sympathy in his tone. To him, also,\r\n",
      "there was a peak higher than Mont Blanc’s to attain.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very true, Jacques,” said Saint-Péray. “I hope we may both find\r\n",
      "favour.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young mountaineer nodded again.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And in the meanwhile, monsieur, there is no favour imperilled by\r\n",
      "showing what resolute fellows we are. I was even now on my way to\r\n",
      "monsieur. This mist presages a sunny morrow. Monsieur, the mountain\r\n",
      "still waits to be scaled.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must wait, Jacques, for me. There are rarer heights to gain. For\r\n",
      "the moment I hold my life like the frailest vessel, which it is my\r\n",
      "duty to protect from so much as a breath of danger.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, monsieur, that sounds funny to me. But then, manliness is my\r\n",
      "only recommendation. To win a great name out of venture—there is my\r\n",
      "chance, and now more than ever.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why now, Jacques?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Monsieur has not heard? Dr Paccard has been appointed physician to\r\n",
      "the Château. Dr Paccard will be a big man presently—too big to\r\n",
      "countenance a son-in-law chosen from the people.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Since when has he been appointed, Jacques?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Since last night, monsieur, by the talk. It tells of how the\r\n",
      "monsignore’s erst familiar, the seer Bonito, came down into the\r\n",
      "village raging over his dismissal. And there are other whispers—of a\r\n",
      "libertine reformed; of changes projected at the Château. I know\r\n",
      "little of their import, I—only this, that Jacques Balmat will lose\r\n",
      "nothing by conquering the mountain. Shall we not join hands, monsieur,\r\n",
      "in essaying once more a triumph which would make all men our\r\n",
      "debtors—monsieur, to win or perish?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Saint-Péray shook his head.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Another time, Jacques,” he said. “My claim to conquest must rest on\r\n",
      "lower deserts. Bonne chance, camarade!” And he went on his way, to\r\n",
      "meet the fate of the irresolute; while young Balmat went on his, to\r\n",
      "climb to his Martha by-and-by.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Louis-Marie was grown thoughtful as he walked on. Nature somehow\r\n",
      "seemed a little further from his knowledge than before; the talk\r\n",
      "between the flowers and the rain was like a whispered conspiracy; the\r\n",
      "dank air chilled him. As he turned out of the village into the wet\r\n",
      "meadows, which sloped gently upwards towards Le Marais, he started to\r\n",
      "see a figure standing by a little freshet as if awaiting him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gaston!” he cried, with an irresistible thrill of guiltiness in his\r\n",
      "note.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Trix wore, making a grace of necessity, a thick dove-grey\r\n",
      "redingote. His buckish little “tops,” which came but half-way up his\r\n",
      "calves, appeared scarcely soiled by the rain and mud. The smallest of\r\n",
      "black cocked hats was placed jauntily on his black curls, of which\r\n",
      "one, and one only, was privileged to accent the whiteness of his fine\r\n",
      "forehead. Over his head he carried a small Spanish silk umbrella, an\r\n",
      "innovation of such effeminacy that his daring it at all in the teeth\r\n",
      "of fashion testified to something in his character which was at least\r\n",
      "as noteworthy as his foppishness. Like the dandy wasp, with his waist\r\n",
      "and elegance and sting, there was that suggestion in Mr Trix of an\r\n",
      "ever-ready retort upon the rashness of his critics. Some men there are\r\n",
      "who carry swords in their eyes, and no one laughed at Cartouche the\r\n",
      "macaroni unless behind his back.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He came up to Louis-Marie, and took his arm with an assured frankness.\r\n",
      "His smile showed an enviable regularity of teeth.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I purposed to meet you,” he said. “Are you in a hurry?”\r\n",

      "few moments of my peril.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eyes of the hawk, Louis-Marie. Well, I saved your life, you say. It\r\n",
      "is certainly the only thing I ever saved, and therefore perhaps, like\r\n",
      "a spendthrift, I put a particular value on it.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And I too, Gaston, I assure you. There was never a time when I held\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“What! is my life in danger?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "is one who has it in his power to administer to you the potion of\r\n",
      "virtue, so that you shall wish to marry and live respectable,’ I\r\n",
      "should say that my life was in peril. But one man’s food is another\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well. Then there is a priest at Le Marais, I believe—a\r\n",
      "professional dealer in such potions. There is also, if I am not in\r\n",
      "error, the necessary other party to such a transaction awaiting you\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We are blood-brothers,” answered Cartouche, quietly; “comrades of a\r\n",
      "very recent sentiment. I honour the tie, despite—I say despite—an\r\n",
      "older and, to me, more natural one. I mean no reflection upon anything\r\n",
      "but the blindness of two simplicities, living, privately as they\r\n",
      "suppose, in a little-high paradise of their own. Will you not be\r\n",
      "satisfied with a hint? Will you not believe in its sincerity, though I\r\n",
      "tell you that I should profit personally by its acceptance by you? You\r\n",
      "have chosen to take me on trust. I choose to vindicate that confidence\r\n",
      "by assuring you that my patron di Rocco has spoiled more idylls in his\r\n",
      "time than I can tell. He is in the way to ruin yet another, this time\r\n",
      "by the Church’s sanction; and his arguments, from the worldly point of\r\n",

      "waiting there for the other to join her. A picture of the sacred heart\r\n",

      "presently, with a quivering sigh, she raised it, and, seeing her lover\r\n",
      "still bowed down in prayer, turned towards the entrance as if seeking\r\n",
      "light. So the young virgin of Nazareth might have turned, in great\r\n",

      "summer months for the benefit of those (not many in 1783) who came to\r\n",
      "enjoy the view. There, in a green oasis, planted amongst the\r\n",
      "stupendous buttresses of the mountains, lived Nicholas Target and his\r\n",
      "daughter Margot, the latter a good sensible girl and the responsible\r\n",
      "aubergiste. The father was a drunken scamp, a guide by profession,\r\n",
      "but long discredited as such in the eyes of all but his daughter,\r\n",
      "whose faithful heart continued to make its compromise with the\r\n",

      "the moraine of the Winds, where, in a tiny shed, he kept a store of\r\n",
      "woollen socks for the feet of those who desired to cross the glacier.\r\n",

      "\n",

      "glacier. She took a bed at the inn, and cold command, as by right of\r\n",
      "her husband, its rent-lord, of its general conduct. She had always had\r\n",

      "that any consummation to that tyranny but Death’s was unspeakable.\r\n",

      "actually on the glacier, when by great ill-fortune he had fallen a\r\n",
      "second time. On each occasion the lantern he carried had been\r\n",
      "extinguished, and had had to be relighted. Monsignore, on the\r\n",
      "repetition of his mishap, had flown into an ungovernable rage,\r\n",
      "snatched the light from him, and, driving him from his presence with\r\n",
      "blows and curses, had bade him seek his own way to the rocks, for that\r\n",
      "he would trust himself to his guidance no longer. The man was a demon\r\n",

      "cabin by the moraine, where he had crouched, waiting for Monsignore to\r\n",
      "follow. While he dwelt there, there had broken over the glacier one of\r\n",

      "thought impossible. Its cessation was not followed by the arrival of\r\n",

      "The Royal Palace of Turin, situated off the Piazza Castello, in the\r\n",
      "east, or distinguished quarter of the city, epitomised in itself the\r\n",
      "policy of the Savoyard rule. Externally it was as unpretentious a pile\r\n",
      "as any brick-built factory—or, shall we say, for the sake of apt\r\n",
      "analogy, as our own original South Kensington Museum. For, in like\r\n",
      "manner with that illustrious emporium, did the utilitarian face which\r\n",
      "it turned to the street afford no clue whatever to its inner meaning.\r\n",
      "It was just a countenance dressed for the demos—a sop of\r\n",
      "unostentation offered to that triple-headed sleuth-hound.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was certainly unelating as an architectural composition; but then\r\n",
      "we know, by the story, that the plain pear is often the most luscious.\r\n",
      "Beauty, saith the sage (a plain fellow himself, no doubt), is but\r\n",
      "skin-deep. That is an aphorism as untrue as many another. But, take it\r\n",
      "for what it is worth, and ugliness, by the like measure, is also\r\n",
      "skin-deep.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Palazzo Reale, at least, was, like its later South Kensington\r\n",
      "parallel, a very museum of treasures contained within a mean casket.\r\n",
      "They were of all sorts, from a Benvenuto salver, or a suit of mail\r\n",
      "worn by an enormous armiger at the battle of Pavia, to the individual\r\n",
      "“kit” of M. Dupré, who had been “le Dieu de la danse” in the\r\n",
      "supreme days of Turin’s gaiety. Those, perhaps, were fled for ever, as\r\n",
      "a characteristic and prerogative of “privilege”; but their reactionary\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I am not sure but that the present representative of the house did not\r\n",

      "for him his beautiful ideal of humanity frolicking in an Arcadian\r\n",
      "estate. Watteau, Gillot, and the fête galante were always figured\r\n",
      "in the dim backgrounds of his policy. He yearned to educate democracy\r\n",
      "with a harpsichord, and pelt it into silence with roses. He was not\r\n",
      "altogether a bad little fellow, for his fifty-seven years, only his\r\n",
      "ideals were expensive, and of course supremely unpractical. While\r\n",
      "seeing very clearly that Arcadia was only to be reached through\r\n",
      "education (he endowed and encouraged learning quite handsomely), he\r\n",
      "stultified all the effects of his liberality by conceding to\r\n",

      "anticipation, the possible flavour of the fruit hidden behind that\r\n",

      "that he might have been taken for the First Lord of the Treasury just\r\n",
      "emerged from a dip into one of its coffers. The royal toilet itself\r\n",
      "was a négligé—dressing-gown, embroidered slippers, and bare\r\n",
      "close-cropped head—all very gimp and finical. Shrewd, wizened,\r\n",
      "narrow, Victor-Amadeus’s face—a dough-white, flexuous-nosed,\r\n",
      "long-chinned, under-jawed little affair—perked up from its collar of\r\n",
      "white ermine like a beedy-eyed condor’s. Thought was engraved on it in\r\n",
      "a number of thready wrinkles, like cracks in parchment. The deepest\r\n",
      "owed themselves to profound self-searchings on such questions as the\r\n",
      "conduct of Court precedents, of royal hunts, of ceremonial and\r\n",
      "pageantry. The slightest might record some difficult moments accorded\r\n",
      "to the size of a button, or the claims of the subversive shoe-tie over\r\n",

      "that they never excluded the necessity of some new drain upon the\r\n",
      "exchequer. Victor-Amadeus recognised very clearly that the true\r\n",

      "seems impossible to advocate even so much, or so little, as a return\r\n",

      "petit-mâitre, in short, of the first rank and the most fastidious\r\n",
      "taste, who had spent his reigning life in offering himself a leading\r\n",

      "Within a stone’s throw of the royal Palace, under its usurious eye,\r\n",
      "as it were, stood the Palazzo di Citta, the headquarters of the Banco\r\n",
      "del Regio Lotto. There, every alternate Saturday at noon, the drawing\r\n",
      "of the numbers took place, and the impoverishment of a few thousand\r\n",
      "King’s subjects, guilty of nothing but fatuity, was decided by lot.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a recurrently mad time, whose agitation was transmitted to\r\n",
      "remotest parishes all over the country—only with this distinction:\r\n",
      "the Piémontais, watching the central game, was held hostage to its\r\n",
      "excitement; the poor Savoyard, ruined out of sight, cursed himself for\r\n",
      "a blockhead victim to fraud, and, with the common inconsistency, vowed\r\n",
      "hatred against a Government which could thus rob him of his mite.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was inevitable. Gambling in cold blood can only breed usurers\r\n",
      "where it succeeds, and desperadoes where it fails. The Turinois\r\n",
      "possessed the glitter of the table. It was not he who was to fail the\r\n",
      "Monarchy in the dark days to come.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was as fevered, as voluble, as gesticulatory, as seething in his\r\n",
      "numbers on this particular occasion of the drawing, as he had been any\r\n",
      "time since M. D’Aubonne first brought his damnable invention of the\r\n",
      "lottery-wheel from France some fifty years earlier. His cheek was as\r\n",
      "glowing, his heart as fluttering with a sense of novelty, as if he had\r\n",
      "never before seen a hundred or two of butterflies broken on the wheel.\r\n",
      "Even Dr Bonito, standing amidst the pack with a young friend, felt the\r\n",
      "infection of the occasion, and bit his blue lips with that sort of\r\n",

      "him one. The stars, the cards (a greasy pack), the astrolabe and\r\n",
      "divining rod, had procured him thence, latterly, an obscene living. In\r\n",
      "taking it, he had had at least the justification of his own\r\n",
      "superstition. If he sold immortal truths at a halfpenny apiece, it was\r\n",
      "only because necessity obliged him. They had all the value of\r\n",
      "genuineness in his eyes, and to “fake” antiques would only discredit\r\n",
      "him with the gods, upon whom was his ultimate reliance. What he had\r\n",
      "borrowed from Louis-Marie had been a loan to conviction—a last ounce\r\n",
      "of metal needed to insure his winged feet to the Perseus of his\r\n",
      "destiny. That he fully believed. Beyond it—it was a fact—he had not\r\n",

      "themselves the owners of the mansion. The maggots which devour a dead\r\n",
      "faith were bred in it living. Superstition, cast down, becomes the\r\n",
      "prey of what it had entertained. Dr Bonito, a Rosicrucian by\r\n",
      "conviction, had never perhaps been really dangerous until the stars\r\n",

      "rascality towards anyone. He may even have felt a little cold thaw of\r\n",
      "emotion towards the human souls about him, as towards beings\r\n",
      "predestined to witness in him alone, conversant with the hieroglyphics\r\n",
      "of fate, that apotheosis which they all desired vainly for themselves.\r\n",
      "Smugly self-conscious of his frowsy coat and broken shoes, he likened\r\n",

      "travelled to the number. Even Louis-Marie, standing staring in his\r\n",
      "place, felt in his veins a sluggish thrill of excitement. Again the\r\n",
      "wheel turned, and again the card duplicated its record—81; and then\r\n",
      "once more it revolved and disgorged a single number—9, and the\r\n",
      "quatern was accomplished.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "painted; the flowers in her cheeks were well assumed, since they owed\r\n",
      "to the rubbing of geranium petals. All these, with that gleaming gold\r\n",
      "for crown, that spun starlight of her hair, were but so many modistic\r\n",
      "arts, to which her simple dress of black supplied the clue. Out of\r\n",

      "whiteness—a cunning scheme of contrasts.\r\n",

      "bring them to her feet—not to sue, but to deprecate all suit of her\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had beauty; and it was not a snare. She had virtue, and it was not\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "world—no bond to honour, even, since she had let another cross the\r\n",
      "claim of his friend. He would never have suffered that for himself.\r\n",
      "She would never have dared that sin against Cartouche. He gloried\r\n",

      "a woman’s modelling, not a saint invertebrately blessed—a passion,\r\n",
      "not a sentiment! Was it too late even now? To gain the whole world in\r\n",
      "her and lose his soul! She could make an immortal lust of\r\n",

      "almost beyond endurance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was her power? He had accepted this interview, when thrust upon\r\n",

      "the moral drubbing it was to procure him. He knew that, in her regard,\r\n",
      "not all his brilliant worldly gifts and qualities weighed as one grain\r\n",
      "in the balance of good things. A word from Louis’s lips, a look from\r\n",
      "Louis’s eyes, would have sent him and all his vanities kicking the\r\n",
      "beam. He could not get behind that essential righteousness. It was\r\n",
      "impervious to all cleverness, all intellect, all reason even. She was\r\n",
      "a fool; but a beautiful unattainable fool is as transporting a\r\n",
      "siderite as any other. Wisdom loved a fool—not for the first time in\r\n",

      "partner who most abuses her love. But what, if you please, does man?\r\n",
      "It all turns, in fact, upon the ineradicable human lust for adventure,\r\n",
      "the weariness of the rut, the reach at something out of reach.\r\n",
      "Yolande, as virtue, was forbidden fruit to this vice. Therefore he\r\n",

      "humour.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He found himself, out of that, presently, and moved towards her, very\r\n",
